Some of the factors which should be kept in mind are as follows:

1- Dealing with data leakages 
----------------------------------------------------------------
     For this we in the start only split the datasets into training and testing and then further process are performed
     separatedly i.e. first for traindata sets whole process till model creation then we move to testdata sets and repeat
     the whole process for test datasets

2- Dealing with randomness of data (It should follow standard normal distribution - bell curve)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
