Firewall Penetration Testing

Internal Penetration Testing

Lateral Movement
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Priviledge escalation at Super user level (AD, Kerberos)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Offensive attack at various level
-------------------------------------------------
Stage 1 of my project deals with usage of data harvested from anonymous sources and osint to do sniffing on cyber team .
For this i am going to conduct a blind penetration testing being completely anonymous and may include usage of DMCA resources and here's the hypothesis statement 

Statement : Blockage or Reporting of my SOCKS IP.

Monitoring what attack vector went through the defensive cyber team and what was being blocked 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this i am going to do a indepth analysis of various attack vector and will also take the help of 
AI (Prototype dashboard) to monitor those feature which went through and which was being blocked

Customising my attack vector in such a way that all my attack will went through there defensive cyber team.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this i am going to use my own silent exploits and the attack will be launch from various C&C.

Defensive  Machine learning and deep learning approach to analyze and predict Enterprise level attack 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this i am going to build ML OR DL model which would alert the enterprise if such attacks is in early stage.
